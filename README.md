# leetcode & neetcode interview prep

Working through [leetcode top 150 interview questions](https://leetcode.com/studyplan/top-interview-150/) and the [neetcode roadmap](https://neetcode.io/roadmap). There is about a 90% cross-over between the two lists but I like the neetcode roadmap a little more.

I've also been using a [spreadsheet - NeetCode150](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12HCHIMLL-r-Oq3An9153CtKS7IJxhB0dvshOqubaSVY/edit?usp=sharing) to track my progress which you can make a copy of and do the same.

I'm using Quokka to test my code locally then I submit my problem solution into each web site, which then runs a suite of tests to further validate my submission.

Eat, Sleep, Code, and have fun!
